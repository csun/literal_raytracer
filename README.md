This is a Unity project for simulating the path of light rays through a scene. You can read more about it in my [blog post here.](https://www.csun.io/2022/11/28/literal-raytracer.html)o

To run this project, you'll first need to install Unity version 2020.3.11f1. Once you've done that, you should be able to open the project in Unity.
